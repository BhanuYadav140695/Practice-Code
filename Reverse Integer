Question :
 Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the 
 signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Sample Inputs : x = 123, x = -123 ,x = 120
Sample Outputs : 321 , -321 , 21

Code: 
     class Solution(object):
          def reverse(self, x):
                """
                :type x: int
                :rtype: int
                ""        
                sign = 1 if x > 0 else -1
                x = int(str(abs(x))[::-1])
                return 0 if x > 2147483647 else x * sign
