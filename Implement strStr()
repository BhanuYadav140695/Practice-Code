Question : Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

Sample Input : {haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"},{haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"}
Sample Output : 2 , -1

Code : 
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:        
        return haystack.index(needle) if needle in haystack else -1
