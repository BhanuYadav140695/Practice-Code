Questiion : Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Sample Inputs : [2,0,2,1,1,0] , [2,0,1]
Sample Outputs : [0,0,1,1,2,2] , [0,1,2]

Code : 
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            j=i
            while nums[j-1]> nums[j] and j>0:
                nums[j-1] ,nums[j] = nums[j], nums[j-1]
                j-=1
        
        return nums
